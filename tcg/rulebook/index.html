Bot Zone</li><li>B. Buzz Zone</li><li>C. Junk Zone</li><li>D. Deck Zone</li></ul><p>Every card you play or discard will be placed on the Game Mat. The example above shows where to place IOTABOTS TRADING CARD GAME Decks and the cards that are brought into play during a Match.</p><p><strong>A. Bot Zone</strong>
Bots can be placed on the 5 spaces of the Bot Card Zone following the rules in Main Phase 1.
The Bot Card Zone has a 5-CARD LIMIT. Once all 5 spaces in the Bot Zone are occupied, no further Bot Cards can be Summoned until there is an open Bot Card space in the Bot Card Zone.</p><p><strong>B. Buzz Zone</strong>
Buzz Cards can be activated in Buzz Zone following the rules in Main Phase 1.</p><p><strong>C. Junk Zone</strong>
When cards are destroyed, they are sent face-up to this space. The contents of the Junk Zone are public knowledge, and your opponent can look through it at any time. Be sure to get your opponent&#x27;s permission before going through their Junk Zone.</p><p><strong>D. Deck Zone</strong>
Place your Deck face-down in this space. You can also play IOTABOTS TRADING CARD GAME without a Game Mat. Just be sure to place the cards and Decks in the indicated positions.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="4-game-cards">4. GAME CARDS<a class="hash-link" href="#4-game-cards" title="Direct link to heading">‚Äã</a></h3><p>Two main card types are used in IOTABOTS TRADING CARD GAME: Bot Cards and Buzz Cards. After familiarizing yourself with the Phases of Gameplay, you will understand the special role of each of the cards.</p><p>In all cases where the rules in the rulebook conflict with the rules on a IOTABOTS TRADING CARD GAME game card, the rules on the card have priority.</p><p><strong>BOT CARDS</strong></p><p>A Bot Card is the basic card used to attack your opponent. Bot Cards are identified by the GREEN light effects on the edges and borders of the card. To Summon a Bot you have to pay Mana except if a Bot has a Mana Cost of 0. The Mana Cost for each Bot Card is declared by the number in the blue colored gem in the top right corner. For details on introducing the Bot Cards into play see Main Phase 1 .</p><p align="center"><img align="center" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80335737/158676925-4e52fd97-40d9-4ab9-b3c8-e31e489fdcb9.png" width="25%" height="25%"></p><p><strong>BOT EFFECTS</strong></p><p>Some Bot Cards have effects. The broad range of Effects are devided into the types listed on the following page. For details regarding the effects, refer to the instructions printed on each individual card.</p><p align="center"> <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80335737/158676977-3bdb3491-6ec0-4491-92f3-1c21d396c14d.png" width="25%" height="25%"></p><ul><li><em>Continuous Effect</em> : As long as this Bot Card is on the field, its effect remains active.</li><li><em>Ignition Effect</em> : You can use this effect by declaring its activation. You can normally activate this effect during your Main Phase. There are some cards which need a cost to activate, such as discarding cards from your hand or tributing a bot on your side of the field. Because you can choose when to activate this effect, it is easy to make a combo with it.</li><li><em>Trigger Effect</em> : These cards are activated when you have fulfilled a specific requirement.</li></ul><p><strong>TOKEN</strong></p><p>Token are used IN PLACE of Bot Cards. The Token represent Bots that appear on the field as a result of a card being activated. These Token are not included in a Deck.</p><p>When put into play, Token are placed on the Bot Zone of the Game Mat. When destroyed, Token are returned to a player&#x27;s hand by card effects, they are also removed from the field.

Buzz Cards are identified by the YELLOW light effects on the edges and borders of the card. To activate a Buzz Card you have to pay Mana except if a Buzz Card has a Mana Cost of 0. The Mana Cost for each Buzz Card is declared by the number in the blue colored gem in the top right corner. Once the effect of a Buzz Card is resolved you must put it face-up on the Junk Zone.</p><p align="center"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80335737/158677054-df395104-34b8-430a-a5d1-78fd4b59bd48.png" width="25%" height="25%"></p><p><strong>MANA</strong></p><p><strong>MANA COSTS</strong></p><p>The Mana Costs are declared by the number in the blue colored gem in the top right corner. For every card you want to summon or activate you have to pay the according Mana Costs.</p><p><strong>MANA POOL</strong></p><p>Your Mana Pool is the place where the amount of your current Mana is displayed. You can represent the amount of Mana in your Mana pool with a dice.
You start your first turn with 1 Mana in your Mana Pool. Every turn after that you get 1 additional Mana added to your Mana Pool when you enter your Standby Phase. The maximum amount of Mana in your Mana Pool is 6. When you&#x27;ve reached 6 Mana in your Mana pool you won&#x27;t get additional Mana after that. Your Mana Pool is refilled every time during the Standby Phase. Your Mana Pool made empty every time you end your turn.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="5-phases-of-gameplay">5. PHASES OF GAMEPLAY<a class="hash-link" href="#5-phases-of-gameplay" title="Direct link to heading">‚Äã</a></h3><p><strong>GAME PLAY TERMINOLOGY</strong></p><p><strong>Turn</strong>
Gameplay progresses in a series of alternating turns. Each players&#x27; turn consists of six phases in which a number of actions can be undertaken.</p><p><strong>Phase</strong>
Phases define the order in which actions can be undertaken by a player during their turn. Each phase is limited to a specific set of actions.</p><p><strong>Step</strong>
A sub-category of a phase. This is only used in the Battle Phase.</p><p align="center"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80335737/158677176-895b3229-daed-4e48-837f-5a45b8619c31.png" width="50%" height="50%"></p><p><strong>DRAW PHASE</strong>
During this phase, you are required to draw 1 card from the top of your Deck. A player who is out of cards and unable to draw during this phase is declared the loser.</p><p><strong>STANDBY PHASE</strong>
If there are any cards in play on the field that specifically state that certain actions must be taken during this phase, these must be dealt with prior to entering the Main Phase. Refer to the cards for specific details regarding the actions to be taken. If there are no such cards in play, proceed to Main Phase 1.</p><p><strong>MAIN PHASE 1</strong>
During this phase, you may: (1) Summon Bot Cards, (2) activate Buzz Cards. Keep in mind that you have to pay the Mana Cost for each card you play. You can not attack with a Bot in the turn it has been summoned. Once a Buzz Card is placed on the field it is activated immediately and is then destroyed. </p><p><strong>Controlling an opponents Bot</strong></p><p>Certain Buzz Cards and Bot Effects have the effect of giving you control over an opponents Bot. When this occurs, use the following rules:
When you take control of an opponents Bot, move the Bot Card to your own Bot Card Zone. Treat it as if it&#x27;s your own card for the duration of the effect. If this Bot Card has an effect you can activate it if requirements are met. A Bot you control counts towards your 5 card Bot Card Zone limit. Therefore, you cannot take control of an opponents Bot if your Bot Card Zone is filled.
Bot Cards under your control can be used in the same way as your own Bot Cards: to attack, defend, or to use as a Tribute. Controlled Bot Cards destroyed or tributed are sent to your opponent&#x27;s Junk Zone.</p><p><strong>BATTLE PHASE</strong></p><p>Once attack preparations have been made in Main Phase 1, you enter the Battle Phase. If you don&#x27;t wish to conduct a Battle Phase, your turn proceeds to the End Phase.</p><p>Keep in mind that the starting player cannot conduct a Battle Phase in their first turn, even if they have placed a Bot Card on the field.</p><p><strong>BATTLE PHASE IN SHORT</strong></p><ol><li><p>START STEP
Declare that you are entering the Battle Phase.</p></li><li><p>BATTLE STEP
Select and announce 1 Bot to attack with, and declare 1 of your opponents Bots or your opponent Life points as the target.</p></li><li><p>DAMAGE STEP
Calculate the damage points of the designated Bot. If a Bot has an Effect triggered by the conditions apply it immediately after damage calculation.</p></li></ol><p>Resolve all battles by repeating the Battle and Damage Steps as many times as necessary, then declare an end to your Battle Phase.</p><p><strong>BATTLE PHASE IN DETAIL</strong></p><ol><li><p>Start Step

However, a single Bot can only attack once per turn. The attacking player chooses 1 of their Bots and designates 1 of the opponents Bots or the opponents Life points as a target.
